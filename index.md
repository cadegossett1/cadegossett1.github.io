Welcome! My name is Cade Gossett, I am a graduate student studying Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M, where I recently recived my BS in Aerospace Engineering. I currently conduct research under <span style="color:blue">[Dr. Gray Thoams](https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/profiles/thomas-gray.html)</span> at the <span style="color:blue">[Human Empower Robotics and Controls Lab](https://herc.engr.tamu.edu/)</span>, where I am currently working on setting up a 7-DOF KUKA robotic manipulator to be used for a variety of projects around the lab; anywhere from strength amplification to testing space grade magnetic gear boxes. My passion mostly lies in hardware, mechanical and eletrical, and optimization within human-spaceflight. With growing skills in embedded systems and microcontrollers built on top of a solid foundation of Computer Aided Design skills, I hope to contribute to a team that is putting forward technology to make tomorrow's space missions possible.
