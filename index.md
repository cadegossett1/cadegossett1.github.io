Welcome! I'm **Cade Gossett**, a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University, where I focus on robotics, embedded systems, and human-spaceflight applications.

I love working at the intersection of **hardware**, **software**, and **systems design**, especially when it means prototyping robots or designing for extreme environments like the lunar surface.
