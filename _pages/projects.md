## ðŸ¤– 6DOF Robotic Arm

A personal robotics project to build a full 6DOF articulated arm using stepper motors, 3D-printed actuators, and custom PCB wiring. Integrating with **ROS 2 Humble** and exploring closed-loop control.

- Inspired by the UR3 Cobot
- CAD and simulation in SolidWorks
- Stepper motor control via Arduino and ROS
- Goals: inverse kinematics + teach pendant control

## ðŸŒ• NASA Lunar Lander Capstone

As **Project Manager**, I led a 4-person lunar lander design team through full system lifecycle for a reusable hydrogen/LOx lander.

- Validated landing dynamics via 1/6th scale drop tests in regolith simulant
- Reduced dry mass by 15% compared to Apollo LM
- Designed for HLS architecture at the lunar south pole

## ðŸ¦¾ Strength Amplification Research â€“ RAD Lab

Designed a 3D-printed ergonomic end effector with embedded F/T sensor and custom button logic for controlling a strength-amplifying robotic system.

- Integrated with industrial robot hardware and magnetic gearboxes
- Reduced noise in analog sensor readings with pull-up resistor logic
- Hand-soldered compact harness to route signals through robot joint wiring

## ðŸ§  Virtual Reality for Spaceflight Psychology â€“ Bioastronautics Lab

Contributed to Unreal Engine-based VR project aimed at improving astronaut mental health on long-duration missions.

- Implemented rock-skipping physics and throwing mechanics
- Designed immersive interaction loop with thermal, wind, and olfactory cues
